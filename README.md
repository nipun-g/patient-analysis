# patient-analysis

Each of the python files contains a class - it further contains methods to perform analysis.

read_and_transform_data.py: Contains methods to load files and fill in the missing values
feature_analysis.py:        Contains methods to analyse features
feature_engineering.py:     Contains methods to engineer extra features for the models
data_modeling.py:           Contains models regression and random forest to find insights about driving factors of cost of care.

driver_main.py: The only exception is driver_main.py, which contains snippets of code that should be run to get the output
from that particular function. This code snippet can be run in console, or in another python file. But please
refrain from running the file as is.
